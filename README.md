## Introduction 
 
Ethereum transaction builder and signer application for smart contract interactions.

Built with React and Bootstrap. The application is coded in ECMAScript 2016 and wrapped together using Webpack. For the deployment of the contract Go Ethereum is used. For the API calls Etherscan.IO API service is used.

All private keys are held 100% on the client side and transaction is constructed in JavaScript, making this optimal for non-custodian wallets or Dapps. 

We use both command line Node.js tools and browser based JavaScript in this application.

I also made sure to add as much comments as possible for anyone planning to use my code to understand it clearly and be able to replicate it.
